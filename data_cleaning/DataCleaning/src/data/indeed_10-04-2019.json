With over 25,000 installations worldwide, Indyme is a well-known and respected brand. Our gold-plated customer list includes some of the biggest names in retail including Target, Lowe?s, Walmart, Safeway, Walgreens, CVS and Albertsons just to name a few.\n\nIndyme urgently needs a data analytics resource who can manipulate and anayze a dataset of ~500,000 records. We first need to manipulate the dataset to get it into a usable format, then perform analysis to identify trends and patterns within the data.\n\nThe data set contains approximately 500,000 call records from 15 different stores in various regions of the country. Each record is a call log that contains a time stamp, and the path of the call as well as the elapsed time the call is engaged by the call director. We need to find out where the calls are being directed, when they are occurring (time of day and day of week) and look for any regional differences across 15 geographic regions. This analysis will be used to optimize their call director and drive traffic to self serve applications rather than talking to store associates.\n\nOur client receives 200 million phone calls a year, and this figure is just calls to stores and excludes their call center calls. In fact, 40% of these calls are from employees and not customers. As a result of the extremely high call volume, and the need to free up store associates to improve the customer experience, this is a high leverage and high profile project.
